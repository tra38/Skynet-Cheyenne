There are 7 Templates you need to make, based on Booker's glorious plan.

---Overcoming the Monster - there is a monster, and your goal is to kill it.
1) Anticipation Stage - the Monster makes its presence known. There are three types of monsters:

---Predator: Prowls around, trying to find victims. The Devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
---Holdfast: Zealously guards a Treasure or a Princess. Very suspicious of any strangers, but may be sleeping when the Hero comes to claim it.
---Avenger: "When its guardianship is in any way challenged," the Monster rushes out to find and destroy those who've taken its Treasure.

2) Call to Action - (get it from another character!)

3) Dream Stage - the hero prepares to fight the monster

4) Frustation Stage - first combat against the Monster. Monster wins. Hero/ine gets upset.

5) Nightmare Stage - more thrilling combat against the Monster. This time, the hero/ine wins.

6) "The Thrilling Escape from Death"/"Death of the Monster"  - Monster dies.

To symbolically complete the tale, the Hero receives three things:
---A treasure (an inheritance counts)
---A kingdom (something to rule over, e.g., a cook hero might get his own restaurant)
---A Princess (or, in the case of a female Hero, a Prince - either way, it's the ultimate mate, the Hero's other half)

Do we really want a tale to be completed?

---The Voyage - it's the Hero's Journey...this time without any point!

1) Anticipation Stage and 'Fall' into the Other World
The Hero's "consciousness is in some way restricted," most commonly because she's young, or because she has a serious flaw, or because she's "bored, or drowsy, or reckless." It is also commonly a blow to the head or some other injury. The character regains consciousness in an alternate reality.

2) Initial Fascination or Dream Stage
This new world is "puzzling and unfamiliar" - hence, cool! The hero explores.
Booker does note that, no matter how cool this whole setup might seem, "it is never a place in which they can feel at home."

3) Frustration Stage
The "mood of the adventure" starts to darken. It's not as easy as before, and options are disappearing; the hero's starting to get hemmed in. "A shadow begins to intrude, which becomes increasingly alarming."

4) Nightmare Stage
The shadow takes center stage, and it looks like the hero is doomed!

5) Thrilling Escape and Return
Just when it looks like it's over, the hero makes a dramatic exit back to the world she came from.
But the real question is: Was there any Character Development? "Have they been fundamentally changed, or was it all just a dream?"

Actually, hang on, the Voyage actually seems more useful. I mean, instead of fighting a monster, you're just seeing the area. Suddenly, boom, Monster, and the Hero runs away like the coward he is.

Man, these plots are way too basic and formulaic. Why would anyone ever read them? (Because of the details within the story. The 'worldbuilding'. You are not interested in seeing the Hero run away from the Monster for the 605th time, you want to see what the Monster is, you want to see the magical world, and you want to know whether the Hero has changed. It's the details that matter, not the plot...)


Tradgey - Where do Monsters come from?
1) Anticipation Stage
The Hero gets focused on "some unusual gratification... object of desire or course of action." At this point, he is "incomplete or unfulfilled."
2) Dream Stage
Like in many other stories, the Tragic Hero gets "committed to his course of action" (Booker mentions Faust's Deal with the Devil as an example). There's no turning back now. However, at first "things go almost improbably well for the hero." Even if he's doing bad things, nobody seems to be catching on, or even if they catch on they seem unable or unwilling to stop him - he's "getting away with it."
3) Frustration Stage
Things start to go wrong... perhaps very slowly, "almost imperceptibly," but the Hero is starting to experience difficulties and annoyances. He may decide, at this point, to do "further dark acts which lock him into his course of action even more irrevocably."
There may also appear some "shadow figure" which seems to threaten him (perhaps only in his imagination).
4) Nightmare Stage
Booker describes this stage better than we can: "...things are now slipping seriously out of the hero's control. He has a mounting sense of threat and despair. Forces of opposition and fate are closing in on him."
5) Destruction or Death Wish Stage
He's about to go down, hard. This is caused by either "some final act of violence" or because of the various enemies he's made - the "forces he has aroused against him."

The Tragic Hero's death or destruction releases the world around him from the darkness he had wrought, and the world without him rejoices.

So...the Tradgey is the flip-side of the Overcoming the Monster, all that changes is the ending. This can be useful...

The Rebirth:
No formulaic plot, but it's just the alternate ending of the tragedy, where instead of destruction, the hero realizes the error of his ways and redemes himself. Here's some notes Booker wrote:

1) a young hero or heroine falls under the shadow of the dark power;
2) for a while, all may seem to go reasonably well, the threat may even seem to have receded;
3) but eventually it all approaches again in full force, until the hero or heroine is seen imprisoned in the state of living death;
4) this continues for a long time, when it seems that the dark power has completely triumphed;
5) but finally comes the miraculous redemption: either, where the imprisoned figure is a heroine, by the hero; or, where it is the hero, by a Young Woman or Child.


So we can possibly do 4 out of the 8 plots. 50% chance. Hmph. It has to be done well.

State machine? Or working backwards?

If I work backwards, I decide what ending I want, and then from there, move on.

Maybe I write a short template, and then expand that template outwards. That'll probably be the best. Pick one story ("Overcoming the Monster"), write out the template, and then expand it.


**
"POST MVP" --- TO NEVER!

---Rags to Riches - You start off as a poor person...and you make your way to wealth (Ehh...save that for post-MVP)

---Comedy: Oh god.

---The Quest - there is a location, find it. (Lends itself well to a TEAM)

Party Tpes:
---A close friend who is loyal but little else (Samwise Gamgee);
---A companion who is the hero's very opposite and usually displays opposite emotions, for good or ill (Sancho Panza);
---A large group of faceless minions who die right and left as the story goes on (a la The Odyssey - and often not a single one makes it to the end);
---or a balanced party distinguished by skills, generally Brains, Brawn, and "Soul" (which might be represented by courage, intuition, charisma, compassion, or spiritual power). Here, The Hero may be counted among them, or may beless specialized and merely rely on them.

1) The Call to Action - Hero is restless, and needs to go.

2) The Journey - (Interesting, the "Journey" stage appears to bear a remarkable overlap to Dream Stage/Frustration Stage. Modularism?)
Journey has two enemies:

Monsters:
--Fight them. Kill them. (Or escape, at the very least.) It's like a miniature form of the Overcoming the Monster story, so play up the nature of the beast.

Temptations:
Booker further divides these into the four categories found in The Odyssey:
---"The beautiful but deadly sirens" whose "only aim is to kill."
---Circe, who imprisons but does not kill.
---Calypso, who "so captivates [Odysseus] that he stays seven years in her cave" - but "he stays voluntarily."
---The Land of the Lotus Eaters, "which saps all will in an atmosphere of relaxed self-indulgence."

...So, we guess, the four divisions are Death, Captivity, Distraction, and Self-indulgence.
Anyway, temptations are to be resisted.
(Booker doesn't explicitly include "Illusions" or "Trickery" but maybe they ought to go here. Falling 
prey to an illusion or buying into a false story seems to fit this general pattern.)

Deadly Opposites:
The Hero sees the road up ahead leading between two roaring lions. Or between a giant whirlpool and a giant sea monster. Or between two giant walls of crushing water. Maybe he has to balance on a thin ledge of rock without falling to one side or the other.
This can be a less literal path, of course, but Booker works with the most visual forms. Somehow or other, the Hero must tread a narrow path between two dangers, and any misstep will lead to certain doom. (So don't ignore your tour guides!!)

(Uh...there's a reason why Booker's nonsense is nonsense...)

Journey to the Underworld:
The climb down into the world of death, and the encounter with the spirits there, is a classic motif. Often the spirits can give the Hero some information about his journey that no living being could know, thus enabling him to head the right way or to avoid some upcoming danger.

In between the various tests come periods of rest and succor, during which the party receives advice about the path ahead. (Booker claims this is often from a wise old man and a beautiful young (or ageless) girl.)

4) Arrival and Frustration
We reach the halfway mark, and the journey part is over. But - gasp! - the story has a long way to go! The party is within sight of the goal, but now sees a series of obstacles yet to be overcome.
In The Odyssey, this is when Odysseus arrives home but still has to deal with the suitors before he can claim his wife and home as his own again.

5) The Final Ordeals
A "last series of tests," often following the Rule of Three (Booker's big on that). The final test - which is "the most threatening of all" - may be a test that only the Hero can pass.
Then there's a "thrilling escape from death."

6) The Goal
The Hero has won it all: treasure, kingdom, and Princess. There is "an assurance of renewed life stretching indefinitely into the future."

The Quest seems way too...epic for a short story. It might work for a longer work, but for a short story, you won't be able to cover all this at once. It's way too easy to mess up. Put this as post-MVP. Blowing up monsters seem more suited.
